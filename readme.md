Build a video game bot for Lord of the Rings Online

TODO:

- Build database to store recipes
- Build machine learning model to translate on screen text into words
- Build machine learning model to navigate via mini map

# For Lotro Bot  - V2

Reason: V1 is good, but it's not the best when it comes to dealing with image recognition. Not enough image processing.
Constant checking and fixing
